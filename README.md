# @cucumber/screenplay

[![CI](https://github.com/cucumber/screenplay.js/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cucumber/screenplay.js/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Cucumber Screenplay is a small library for [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/) that enables better 
acceptance tests (Gherkin Scenarios):

* ðŸš… Full-stack acceptance tests that run in **milliseconds**
* ðŸ”“ Encourages loosely coupled system components that are easier to test in isolation  
* ðŸ§© Assembles system components in several ways, so you can optimize for **speed** or **test coverage**
* ðŸ“— Readable scenarios that describe the **what** instead of the **how** 
* ðŸ§° Maintainable automation code

The library is an implementation of the [screenplay pattern](https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/understanding-screenplay-(part-1)/).

When you use Cucumber Screenplay, your step definitions are typically one-liners:

```typescript
When('{actor} logs in', function (actor: Actor) {
  actor.attemptsTo(logIn())
})
```

You can provide several implementations of `logIn()` - one that interacts with the user interface, but *also* one that
interacts with the API layer *underneath* the user interface via direct function calls.

This forces you to avoid UI language in your scenarios like "fill in field" and "click button", because it doesn't make sense to
do that in an API implementation of the `logIn()` function. Likewise, it forces you to avoid using HTTP language like
"execute HTTP POST /login", because it doesn't make sense to do this in the UI implementation of the `login()` function.

So you end up with readable scenarios that describe *what* the user can do, not *how* it's done. Your scenarios become
living documentation that can be understood by everyone on the team.

## Assemblies

With Cucumber Screenplay you can build an acceptance test suite that you can run with multiple configurations. We call
this *assemblies*. Below are some [assembly diagrams](https://github.com/subsecondtdd/assembly-diagrams#readme) that illustrate
these different configurations:

| DOM-HTTP-Domain                                | DOM-Domain                           | HTTP-Domain                            | Domain                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------| ---------------------------- |
| ![DOM-HTTP-Domain](images/dom-http-domain.svg) | ![DOM-Domain](images/dom-domain.svg) | ![HTTP-Domain](images/http-domain.svg) | ![Domain](images/domain.svg) |

## Installation

First, add the library to your project:

    npm install @cucumber/screenplay --save-dev

## Usage

This guide will walk you through the usage of the library step by step. For a full example, please refer to the files
in the `features` directory (which are also acceptance tests for this library).

### Actors

The central concept in `@cucumber/screenplay` is the `Actor`. An actor object represents a user interacting with the
system.

In order to access actor objects from your step definitions, you first need to define an `{actor}` 
[parameter type](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/cucumber-expressions/#parameter-types). 

Create a file called `features/support/World.ts` (if you haven't already got one) and add the following code: 

```typescript
import { defineParameterType, setWorldConstructor } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { ActorWorld, ActorParameterType } from '@cucumber/screenplay'

// Define an {actor} parameter type that creates Actor objects
defineParameterType(ActorParameterType)

// Define your own World class that extends from ActorWorld
export default class World extends ActorWorld {
}
setWorldConstructor(World)
```

Your step definitions will now be passed `Actor` objects for `{actor}` parameters, for example:

```gherkin
Then Martha should hear nothing
```

```typescript
Then('{actor} should hear nothing', async function (actor: Actor) {
  // Do something with the actor
})
```

### Interacting with the system

Now that your step definitions can be passed `Actor` objects, you can use `Actor#attemptsTo` and `Actor#ask` methods
to interact with the system.

The `Actor#attemptsTo` and `Actor#ask` methods are technically synonymous, but it adds some clarity to use `attemptsTo` 
to perform an action that modifies the state of the system, and `ask` to query the system for information. For example:

```typescript
When('{actor} logs in', function (actor: Actor) {
  actor.attemptsTo(logIn())
})

Then('{actor} should be logged-in', function (actor: Actor<World>) {
  assert.ok(actor.ask(isLoggedIn()))
})
```

### Defining interactions and questions

The `Actor#attemptsTo` and `Actor#ask` methods accept a single `Interaction` argument that describes how to perform
an action (or ask a question).

Interactions are simply functions that return another function that expects an `Actor` parameter. For example:

```typescript
export type SignUp = (email: string, password: string) => Interaction<Promise<string>>

export const signUp: SignUp = (email, password) => {
  return async (actor: Actor) => {
    // Interact with the system the way you like (Selenium, API call or whatever)
    return userId // the ID assigned to the user on sign-up
  }
}
```

Now you can use the interaction in your step definitions:

```typescript
const userId = await actor.attemptsTo(signUp('someone@example.com', 'some-secret-password'))
```

(In this example your `Interation` returns a `Promise<string>`. If your system is fully synchronous, you don't
need to return a `Promise`).

### Using different interaction implementations

It can often be useful to have multiple implementations of the same interaction. This allows you
to build new functionality incrementally with fast feedback.

For example, you might be working on a new requirement that allows users to log in. You can start
by building just the server side domain logic without any HTTP or UI, and get quick feedback as you progress.

Then, you can run the same scenarios again, but this time swapping out your interactions with implementations
that make HTTP requests or interact with a DOM - without changing any code.

If you look at the [shouty example included in this repo](./features), you will see that we organized 
our interactions/questions in two directories:

```
features
â”œâ”€â”€ hear_shout.feature
â””â”€â”€ support
    â””â”€â”€ interactions
        â”œâ”€â”€ direct
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inboxMessages.ts
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ moveTo.ts
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shout.ts
        â””â”€â”€ session
            â”œâ”€â”€ inboxMessages.ts
            â”œâ”€â”€ moveTo.ts
            â””â”€â”€ shout.ts
```

In order to decide at run-time what interaction implementations to use, you can use the *interaction loader* provided in `@cucumber/screenplay`:

```typescript
import { setWorldConstructor } from '@cucumber/cucumber'
import { ActorWorld, makeInteractionLoader, defineActorParameterType, Interaction } from '@cucumber/screenplay'

// Declare interaction signatures
type StartSession = (coordinate: Coordinate) => Interaction<Promise<void>>
type Shout = (message: string) => Interaction
type InboxMessages = () => Interaction<readonly Message[]>

export default class World extends ActorWorld {
  public startSession: StartSession
  public shout: Shout
  public inboxMessages: InboxMessages
}
setWorldConstructor(World)

Before(async function (this: World) {
  const interactionsDir = `${__dirname}/interactions/${process.env.CUCUMBER_SCREENPLAY_INTERACTIONS || 'session'}`
  const interaction = makeInteractionLoader(interactionsDir)

  this.startSession = await interaction('startSession')
  this.shout = await interaction('shout')
  this.inboxMessages = await interaction('inboxMessages')
})
```

This will load the appropriate interations based on the value of the `CUCUMBER_SCREENPLAY_INTERACTIONS` environment variable.

If you're using this technique, you also need to adapt your step definitions to reference interactions from the *world* (`this`):

```typescript
When('{actor} shouts {string}', async function (this: World, actor: Actor, message: string) {
  await actor.attemptsTo(this.shout(message))
})
```

### Sharing data between steps

Your actors have the abililty to `remember` and `recall` data between steps. For example:

```typescript
When('{actor} logs in', function (this: World, actor: Actor<World>) {
  const userId = actor.attemptsTo(this.login())
  actor.remember('userId', userId)
})

Then('{actor} should be logged in', function (actor: Actor<World>) {
  assert.ok(actor.recall('userId'))
})
```

You can also pass a function to `remember` to memoize a value:

```typescript
function getSomething(actor: Actor) {
  actor.recall('something', () => ({ foo: 'bar' }))
}

// The same object is returned every time
assert.strictEqual(getSomething(actor), getSomething(actor))
```

**Note:** the data remembered is scoped by `Actor`, so you cannot access data remembered by one actor from another 
one. You can have multiple actors storing different data with the same key. Every `Actor` is discarded at the end of
each scenario, so you won't be able to `recall` anything from previous scenarios.

### Accessing the world from actors

If your interactions need to access data in the `world`, they can do so via the `Actor#world` property. If you're doing this
you should also declare the generic type of the actor in the interaction implementation:

```typescript
export const moveTo: MoveTo = (coordinate) => {
  // We're declaring the World type of the actor so that we can access its members
  return async (actor: Actor<World>) => {
    actor.world.shouty.moveTo(actor.name, coordinate)
  }
}
```

### Handling asynchronous behaviour

In a distributed system it may take some time before the outcome of an action propagates around the whole system.

For example, in a chat application, when one user sends a message, it may take a few milliseconds before the 
other users receive the message, because it travels through a network.

In cases like this you can use the `eventually` function to periodically check for a specific condition:

```typescript
Then('{actor} hears {actor}â€™s message', async function (this: World, listener: Actor<World>, shouter: Actor) {
  const shouterLastMessage = shouter.recall('lastMessage')

  await eventually(() => {
    const listenerMessages = listener.ask(this.inboxMessages())
    assert.deepStrictEqual(listenerMessages, [shouterLastMessage])
  })
})
```

The `eventually` function accepts a single argument - a zero argument `condition` function. If the `condition` function 
throws an error, it will be called again at a regular `interval` until it passes without throwing an exception. If it doesn't
pass or finish within a `timeout` period, a timeout error is thrown.

The default `interval` is `50ms` and the default `timeout` is `1000ms`. This can be overridden with a second 
`{ interval: number, timeout: number}` argument after the `condition`.

## Advanced Configuration

Below are some guidelines for more advanced configuration.

### Using Promises

The default type of an `Interaction` is `void`. If your system is asynchronous
(i.e. uses `async` functions that return a `Promise`), you can use the `PromiseInteraction`
type instead of `Interaction`:




### Using an explicit ActorLookup

If you cannot extend `ActorWorld`, you can add an `ActorLookup` field to your existing world class like so:

```typescript
import { ActorLookup } from '@cucumber/screenplay'

class World {
  private readonly actorLookUp = new ActorLookup()

  public findOrCreateActor(actorName: string): Actor<World> {
    return this.actorLookUp.findOrCreateActor(this, actorName)
  }
}
```

### Overriding ActorParameterType options

The `defineParameterType(ActorParameterType)` function call defines a parameter type named `{actor}` by default,
and it uses the RegExp `/[A-Z][a-z]+/` (a capitailsed string).

If you want to use a different name or regexp, you can override these defaults:

```typescript
defineParameterType({ ...ActorParameterType, name: 'acteur' })
defineParameterType({ ...ActorParameterType, regexp: /Marcel|Bernadette|Hubert/ })
defineParameterType({ ...ActorParameterType, name: 'acteur', regexp: /Marcel|Bernadette|Hubert/ })
```

## Design recommendations

When you're working with `@cucumber/screenplay` and testing against multiple layers, we recommend you use only two
interaction implementations:

* `dom` for interactions that use the DOM
* `session` for interactions that use a `Session`

A `Session` represents a user (actor) having an interactive session with your system. A `Session` will typically be used 
in two places of your code:

* From your `session` interactions
* From your UI code (React/Vue components etc)

`Session` is an interface that is specific to your implementation that you should implement yourself. Your UI code 
will use it to interact with the server. This separation of concerns prevents network implementation details to
bleed into the UI code.

You'll typically have two implementations of your `Session` interface - `HttpSession` and `ShoutySession`.

The `HttpSession` is where you encapsulate all of the `fetch`, `WebSocket` and `EventSource` logic. This is the class
your UI will use in production. You will also use it in tests.

The `ShoutySession` is an implementation that talks directly to the server side domain layer with direct function calls
(without any networking). This implementation will only be used in tests.

By organising your code this way, you have four ways you can run your Cucumber Scenarios.

* `session` interactions using `ShoutySession` (fastest tests, domain layer coverage)
* `session` interations using `HttpSession` (slower tests, http + domain layer coverage)
* `dom` interactions using `ShoutySession` (slower tests, UI + domain layer coverage)
* `dom` interactions using `HttpSession` (slowest tests, UI + http + domain layer coverage)

In the example we use `CUCUMBER_SCREENPLAY_INTERACTIONS=dom|session` and `CUCUMBER_SCREENPLAY_SESSIONS=http|direct`
to control how to interact with the system and how the system is assembled.
